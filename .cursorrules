# Git Behavior - CRITICAL

## Committing Changes

When ready to commit:

1. First, add any NEW files created that are INTENDED TO BE COMMITTED using `git add <specific-file>`
2. Commit using `git commit -a` (normal workflow, commits all modified tracked files) or `git commit <modified files>` (commit only a subset)

## What NOT to do

- NEVER use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git add --all`
- NEVER add untracked files - they may be the user's local notes, logs, or temporary data

## What Belongs in the Repo vs. What Doesn't

**Commit these** (needed by users of the software):
- Source code
- Dependency specs and project configuration
- User-facing documentation (how to install, use, set up)

**Do NOT commit these** (developer-only artifacts):
- Personal notes, planning docs, internal architecture docs, TODOs
- Local convenience/wrapper scripts
- One-time setup utilities, API key configuration scripts

**Guiding question**: "Would someone cloning this repo to USE the software need this file?"
- Yes → commit it
- No (it's for the developer's workflow/thinking) → don't commit

**When uncertain about a file, ASK before committing.**
